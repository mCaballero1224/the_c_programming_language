# The C Programming Language

Integers, chars, pointers, structs, and some libraries. What more do you need? I've always enjoyed lower-level languages like C and Assembly over something like Python or JavaScript. Of course, low-level and high level are both useful. Working with lower-level languages just makes it easier for me to understand what the code is doing. 

Addmittedly, Assembly can be kind of rough to read at times, so I decided to focus more on C as of late. Hence, this repository: A collection of notes/programs written during my time reading through "The C Programming Language" by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie. Feel free to look through it, whether that be to gain insight on how to solve an exercise, or to comment on something about my solutions that I could improve. 

Something to note is that this book is old. Thus, you'll run into problems that may not have existed when this book was written. For example, during chapter 1, I ran into issues revolving keyboard input. See [`wordcount`](https://github.com/mCaballero1224/the_c_programming_language/tree/main/chapter1/wordcount) for an example of this and how I got around it.
